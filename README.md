# single_file_projects

A sortiment of single-file projects that aren't worth their own repo.

Most if not all of them stem from the Jetbrains Academy Python course, which I highly recommend.

Learning Python by doing small'ish projects is really great, imo.

Anyway, if the names of the files isn't enough of a clue, I've got you covered:

# Coffee Machine
is a simple (text-)ui-guided coffee machine.

It's the very first python project I've done and works just like you'd think:

the machine has a set amount of water/milk/beans/cups/money.

Buying drinks will reduce the water/milk/... and add the cost of the type of coffee to the machines money.

While there's enough resources, you get your coffee. If there's not enough of any resource, the machine tells you what's missing.

You can also supply the machine by filling it up, take the money from it or simply display how much of each resource is left.
